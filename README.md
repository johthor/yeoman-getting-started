# Let's Scaffold a Web App with Yeoman

A fully functional web application build from scratch with a little help from
[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). We'll also use features from
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io). The sample app will
be written in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org).

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
